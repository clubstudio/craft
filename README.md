# Craft CMS Boilerplate

A scaffolding package to help you hit the ground running with your next [Craft CMS](https://craftcms.com) project.

## What's included?

* [Craft CMS](https://craftcms.com)
* [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
* A sensible directory structure
* Commonly used Craft CMS plugins

## Getting Started

Once you're happy that your server/machine meets Craft's [requirements](https://craftcms.com/docs/5.x/requirements.html), you can start your new project by running the following command in your terminal:

```
composer create-project clubstudioltd/craft
```

This will clone a copy of this repo to your machine and automatically install any Composer dependencies.

Next, head over to the Craft [installation documentation](https://craftcms.com/docs/5.x/install.html) and continue the steps.

## Developing

After setting up Craft, you're ready to start building your new project! Before getting started you'll want to pull in all frontend dependencies by running:

```
npm install
```

Once the dependencies have been installed, you can compile assets and start a watcher using:

```
npm run dev
```

That's it! Happy coding! ðŸŽ‰
